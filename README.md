# Causal Fairness Analysis

In this tutorial, we will be exploring a causal fairness analysis, based ona. real-world dataset. Out theoretical framework would be Structural Theory of Causation and we will analyse based on existing work "Causal Fairness Analysis" by Plecko and Bareinboim (2022), and our own additional inferences. For test data, we will use ProPoblica COMPAS dataset. The eventual goal is to transform the idea for our own problem domain and dataset.

We will generate a computational pipeline, present it theoretically and show the data analysis in parallel.

See the notebook for details.
